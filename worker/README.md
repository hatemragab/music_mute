# MusicMute worker runtime

This component contains the native machine supervisor and the isolated Python
processing child. It is intentionally separate from the NestJS backend and the
administrator dashboard.

The Node supervisor owns machine authentication, backend reconciliation, job
authority, leases, transfers, child lifecycle and sanitized diagnostics. The
Python child owns local media preparation, inference and result metadata. Audio
bytes never travel through the child control pipe, and the child never receives
backend or S3 credentials.

## Development

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run verify
```

The generated TypeScript protocol under `protocol/v1/` is copied from the
backend's canonical pure-data protocol. Run `pnpm protocol:sync` after an
intentional backend protocol change. `pnpm protocol:check` fails on drift.

Runtime packaging, platform service installation and real GPU evidence are
tracked separately by checkpoints D2-D6. Passing the D1 tests does not certify
CoreML, DirectML, service startup or production readiness.
