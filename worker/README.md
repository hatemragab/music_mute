# MusicMute worker runtime

This component contains the native machine supervisor and the isolated Python
processing child. It is intentionally separate from the NestJS backend and the
administrator dashboard.

The Node supervisor owns machine authentication, backend reconciliation, job
authority, leases, transfers, child lifecycle and sanitized diagnostics. The
Python child owns local media preparation, inference and result metadata. Audio
bytes never travel through the child control pipe, and the child never receives
backend or S3 credentials.

## Development

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
uv venv .venv --python 3.13
uv pip sync --python .venv/bin/python ../tools/worker-gpu-feasibility/requirements-coreml.lock.txt
pnpm run verify
```

On Windows, create the venv with the accepted Python 3.12 runtime and sync
`requirements-directml.lock.txt` instead. `MUSICMUTE_PYTHON` may point the test
runner at an already-qualified interpreter. Do not mix ONNX Runtime
distributions or install these locks globally.

The generated TypeScript protocol under `protocol/v1/` is copied from the
backend's canonical pure-data protocol. Run `pnpm protocol:sync` after an
intentional backend protocol change. `pnpm protocol:check` fails on drift.

Checkpoint D2 implements the four immutable Kim recipes, verified model cache,
safe local-media pipeline and exact reference trimmer. The model is not
redistributed by this repository; it must be installed into the
content-addressed cache and pass the frozen size and SHA-256 checks. Backend
polling/S3 ownership, platform service installation and full safety acceptance
remain checkpoints D3-D6. Passing local tests does not certify service startup
or production readiness.
